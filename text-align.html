                <h1>Etymology</h1>
                <p>Abdul Hamid Lahori, in his book from 1636 Padshahnama, refers to the Taj Mahal as rauza-i munawwara
                     (Perso-Arabic: روضه منواره, rawdah-i munawwarah), meaning the illumined or illustrious tomb.
                      The current name for the Taj Mahal is of Urdu origin, and believed to be derived from Persian and Arabic,
                       with the words tāj mahall meaning "crown" (tāj) "palace" (mahall). 
                       The name "Taj" came from the corruption of the second syllable of "Mumtaz</p>

                <h1>Symbolism</h1>
                <p>Due to the global attention that it has received and the millions of visitors it attracts, 
                    the Taj Mahal has become a prominent image that is associated with India, and in this way has become a symbol of India itself.
                    Along with being a renowned symbol of love, 
                    the Taj Mahal is also a symbol of Shah Jahan's wealth and power, 
                    and the fact that the empire had prospered under his rule.
                     Bilateral symmetry dominated by a central axis has been used by rulers as a symbol
                      of a ruling force that brings balance and harmony, and Shah Jahan applied that concept in the
                       making of the Taj Mahal.[54] Additionally, the plan is aligned in the cardinal north–south direction 
                       and the corners have been placed so that when seen from the center of the plan, 
                       the sun can be seen rising and setting on the north and south corners on the summer and
                        winter solstices respectively.This makes the Taj a symbolic horizon.</p>

                    <h1>Tomb</h1>
                    <p>The tomb is the central focus of the entire complex of the Taj Mahal. 
                        It is a large, white marble structure standing on a square plinth and consists of a 
                        symmetrical building with an iwan (an arch-shaped doorway) topped by a large dome
                         and finial. Like most Mughal tombs, the basic elements are Indo-Islamic in origin</p>

                    <h1>Construction</h1>
                    <p>The Taj Mahal is built on a parcel of land to the south of the walled city of Agra.
                    Shah Jahan presented Maharaja Jai Singh I with a large palace in the centre
                    of Agra in exchange for the land.[45] An area of roughly 1.2 hectares (3 acres) 
                    was excavated, filled with dirt to reduce seepage, and levelled at 50 metres (160 ft) above
                the riverbank level. In the tomb area, piles were dug and filled with stone and rubble to
                     form the footings of the tomb. Instead of lashed bamboo, workmen constructed a colossal
                      brick scaffold that mirrored the tomb.</p>
